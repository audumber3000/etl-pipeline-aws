# ETL Pipeline with AWS

## Overview
This project implements an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline** using **AWS services** to automate data processing tasks. It enables seamless ingestion, transformation, and storage of data while leveraging AWS's robust infrastructure for scalability and efficiency.

## Features
- **S3 Bucket**: Stores incoming CSV files.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes preprocessing scripts triggered automatically when new files are uploaded.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans and structures the data for further analysis.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Stores cleaned and processed data in a structured format.

## Architecture
1. **Data Ingestion**: Files are uploaded to an S3 bucket.
2. **Trigger**: AWS Lambda is triggered upon new file uploads.
3. **Data Processing**: Lambda executes scripts to transform and clean the data.
4. **Data Storage**: The processed data is stored in an RDS instance.

## Challenges
- Optimizing AWS Lambda to handle data processing efficiently.
- Setting up the AWS infrastructure and permissions.
- Ensuring data consistency and integrity during transformations.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple file formats (e.g., JSON, Excel) instead of CSV only.
- Add intelligence to automatically detect and parse file structures.
- Build a monitoring dashboard to track the pipeline’s performance.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/etl-pipeline-aws.git
   ```
2. Configure your AWS environment with necessary IAM roles and permissions.
3. Deploy the Lambda function and connect it to your S3 bucket trigger.
4. Set up an RDS instance and update connection details in the script.
5. Test the pipeline by uploading a sample CSV file to the S3 bucket.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS S3**: For file storage.
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless data processing.
- **AWS RDS**: For relational database storage.
- **Python**: For data transformation scripts.
